GitHub repository link (https://github.com/Chris67813/Project_132.git)

DogeGames is an NFT purchasing website using emulated digital currency that a user can phone through playing a range of online games available on the website. 
Each user we need to register to create their own DogeGames account on their first time visiting the site. After the user logs in with their respective username and password, 
(currently) they can play one of four games to start earning coins. The Quiz, Coin Flip, Snake or Paper Scissors Rock. They can then visit the shop and browse through the 
library of NFTs that are available for purchase (a dynamic library that will periodically be updated with new NFTs). The customer can then “put in the request” to purchase the NFT. 
If the user has sufficient funds, the transaction can proceed. The user can then visit the library of their NFTs or check the current rank on the leaderboard. As the user purchases more 
NFTs, they will increase in the leaderboard rankings.
